## Introduction
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for the classification of COVID-19 using X-ray images. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning techniques, this model utilizes pre-trained architectures such as VGG16, ResNet, and DenseNet to improve the efficiency and accuracy of COVID-19 detection from medical images. The dataset includes train and test sets of X-ray images, and the project is implemented using Python with TensorFlow and Keras frameworks.
